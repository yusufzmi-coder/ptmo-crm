// ============================================================
// Broadcast resume / retry (issue #472).
//
// The dashboard wizard drives its own send loop from the browser tab
// that started the campaign, so closing the tab abandons the campaign
// mid-flight: the remaining recipients stay 'pending' and the
// broadcast sits in 'sending' forever. This module is the recovery —
// and the same machinery answers the reporter's other two asks,
// "reprocess pending" and "reprocess failed".
//
// It deliberately reuses `deliverBroadcast` rather than growing a
// second fan-out loop: same phone-variant retry, same per-recipient
// stamping, same trigger-owned counts.
//
// What it does NOT do is move the *initial* send server-side. The
// wizard still owns that; this makes an abandoned one recoverable.
