/**
 * Copies inbound WhatsApp media into the `chat-media` bucket so it
 * outlives Meta's retention window (issue #466).
 *
 * Meta deletes media roughly 30 days after receipt. Before this, the
 * webhook stored only a pointer — `/api/whatsapp/media/<mediaId>` — and
 * the proxy route behind it re-fetched from Meta on every single view,
 * so an attachment quietly became unviewable a month after it arrived.
 * Outbound media never had the problem: the composer uploads to
 * `chat-media` (migration 023) and stores a durable pointer to it. This
 * puts inbound on the same footing.
 *
 * Everything here is BEST EFFORT and returns `null` rather than
 * throwing. The caller is the Meta webhook, and a webhook that starts
 * failing is worse than an attachment that expires: Meta retries the
 * delivery, which re-runs contact creation, flows, automations and AI
 * replies. On any failure — oversized file, MIME the bucket refuses,
 * storage outage — the caller keeps the proxy URL, which still works
 * for as long as Meta holds the bytes.
